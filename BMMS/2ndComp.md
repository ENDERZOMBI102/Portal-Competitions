Sizes: 3/3<br>
Cheese: 1/5<br>
Lagginess: 1/10<br>
Comment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For the first subchamber, i have nothing to say, its a very simple puzzle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For the second, The timing of the pellet can easely be messed up, and also the cube from the previus room can be moved to this one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For the third, i liked the custom "stationary reflection cube" item, but i think you could have used it more!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Overall a good chamber.<br>
Score: ( 1.5 + 3 + 3 + 5 ) 12.5<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Very easy chamber, with good execution! but what was the "flying chamber" for? i didn't need to go in there to solve the puzzle...<br>

Laser for Faith<br>
Difficulty: 1/5<br>
Sizes: 1/1<br>
Cheese: 5/5<br>
Lagginess: 1/10<br>
Comment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(Cheese run) I didn't even need to use the sedificator, you could just move the cube though the green fizzler and solve the puzzle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(Normal run) I liked very much the spawn room, you don't see many chambers with custom spawns!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The puzzle was very easy, but it had a custom fizzler without spamming it so +1 ;)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Without the cheese, its a decent chamber. <br>
Score: ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1) 9<br>

Comment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It seemed hard at first glance, but then i remembered the chamber title, after that, it was clear what to do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A good execution, small, it was suprisingly good for the size +1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Overall a great chamber. <br>

Comment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Less pistons next time plz, my ears are now bleeding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(First cheese run) I managed to complete the puzzle by making the laser receiver belive it was active, while it wasn't.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(Normal run) it was pretty hard to align the lasers, thanks to some shitty hitbox, but i liked the details of the cubes passing in the vactubes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I also liked very much the secret cube, not many put secrets in their chambers...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Overall, a food and very laggy chamber<br>
Score: ( 2 + 1i + 1 + 2.5 + -0 ) 5.5 + i -> -5.5 -> 5.5<br>
