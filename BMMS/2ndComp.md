		For the first subchamber, i have nothing to say, its a very simple puzzle.
		For the second, The timing of the pellet can easely be messed up, and also the cube from the previus room can be moved to this one.
		For the third, i liked the custom "stationary reflection cube" item, but i think you could have used it more!
		Overall a good chamber.

		Very easy chamber, with good execution! but what was the "flying chamber" for? i didn't need to go in there to solve the puzzle...
		I'm not sure if i cheesed some of it or no, so a ? for you.
		Overall a good chamber.

		(Cheese run) I didn't even need to use the sedificator, you could just move the cube though the green fizzler and solve the puzzle.
		(Normal run) I liked very much the spawn room, you don't see many chambers with custom spawns!
		The puzzle was very easy, but it had a custom fizzler without spamming it so +1 ;)
		Without the cheese, its a decent chamber.

		I liked very much the reuse of the faith plate, and the colored light was a nice touch, not much else to say.
		Short and sweet chamber.

		It seemed hard at first glance, but then i remembered the chamber title, after that, it was clear what to do.
		A good execution, small, it was suprisingly good for the size +1.
		Overall a great chamber.

	Comment:
		Less pistons next time plz, my ears are now bleeding.
		(First cheese run) I managed to complete the puzzle by making the laser receiver belive it was active, while it wasn't.
		(Normal run) it was pretty hard to align the lasers, thanks to some shitty hitbox, but i liked the details of the cubes passing in the vactubes.
		I also liked very much the secret cube, not many put secrets in their chambers...
		Overall, a food and very laggy chamber
